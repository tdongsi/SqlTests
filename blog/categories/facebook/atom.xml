<!--more-->


<p>== Module  1 ==
Ppl looks for different things in data</p>

<pre><code>* Trend: bar, graph
* Average
</code></pre>

<p>Above all else, show data.
Data-pixel ratio: data pixels/non-data pixels.
How to enhance data-pixel ratio:</p>

<pre><code>* Granularity: depends on the question you want to answer
* 
    * monthly if you want to know monthly sales, daily if you want to know what happens last Tuesday.
    * category or sub-category: you can have category with drill down function.

* Annotation: similar to Granularity. Minimize it to enough to answer the question.
</code></pre>

<p>Tricks &amp; Tips:</p>

<pre><code>* Plots (over Bars): plot show the trends for different components over time.
* Sizing Bars: Preserve True Portions: starting Y from 0.
* 
    * Sizing Bars: shows proportions, relative progression.

* Scatter Plots: show clusters, outliers.
* Radio displays: usually a bad idea. Waste of space, hard to discern between slices.
</code></pre>

<p>== Module 2: Common Charts ==</p>

<p>Basic data Presentation Methods - Chart Types</p>

<pre><code>* Geo-Spatial - Maps: anything related to geographic distribution, i.e., when geography matters. e.g. real estates, oil industry.
* Correlation - Scatter Plots: two measurements (e.g., sales to profit).
* Hierarchical - Drill down Tree: data is hierarchical: Category -&gt; Subcateogries.
* Categorical - Bar Charts: comparing categories (sales by region)
* Time Series - Line Charts: progression over time. (sales by month)
* 
    * NOT: Area Charts.

* Distribution - Histograms: Trying to answer what is “normal”. e.g., home prices, salaries.
</code></pre>

<p>Others</p>

<pre><code>* Box plot: distribution, percentiles, median in 1 chart.
* Bullet graph: actuals to target. Invented by Stephen Few.
* 
    * Dark bar is actual, reference line is target. Color code bands are average, good, bad target range.
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_graph

* Sparkline: Multiple line charts. Best used for monitoring dashboard.
* Heat map: Large combinations of dimensions. Color is everything here.
</code></pre>

<p>Charts to avoid</p>

<pre><code>* Pie charts: angles make it hard to compare. Usually decorative, not informative. Space is wasted.
* Polar charts
* Stacked area charts:
* 
    * Only tell the story of the bottom line and the total. Anything in between, you can’t really tell if they are growing or not.
    * Misleading/Confusing: is the top the total or another category?
</code></pre>

<p>== Module 3: Dashboard planning ==</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<pre><code>* User Request
* Prioritization
* Planning
* Design
* Development
* Delivery to User
</code></pre>

<p>== Module 4: Dashboard design ==</p>

<p>Audience is King. Know your audience.</p>

<pre><code>* Who is using it? 
* Are they technical or prefer dumbed down answers? Are they intimate with data?
* What is primary objective? What questions that they try to answer? What questions this dashboard MUST answer?
* What impact of the answer? How will they use metrics? (Role, what decisions they make)
* When will the dashboard is used? (Weekly? Daily?) Dashboard is exploratory or explanatory?
* What level of confidence in data sources?
</code></pre>

<p>Dashboard layout: F layout is the most natural for web/desktop viewing.</p>

<p>== Module 5 &amp; 6: Tableau ==</p>

<p>Connecting to Data:
You can connect to Excel, text file (csv or tab), or HP Vertica.
You can specify data import like Excel or using Custom SQL.
After importing, Tableau may import all data into its own internal data engine (with compression, data reorganization easier for analytics).
It also divides data into dimensions and measures.
Dimensions are further categorized into: geographic (e.g., region, postal code), number, text, date (e.g., calendar, order_date).
Facts are usually numbers but it can be other categories: e.g., geographic for latitude/longitude measures.</p>

<p>Dimensions: context for analysis
Facts (Measures):</p>

<p>Visualizing data:
Tableau has “Show Me” button that gives suggestions for different combinations of dimensions and fact data.</p>

    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/SqlTests/blog/2016/09/15/tutorial-dimensional-modelling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From Kimball group reader.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Design items:
You need to do data profiling to keep data processed to min. One way to profile data changes is to use CDC column.
Check CDC columns: e.g. last_update_ts. If CDC columns are not available, work with production system DBA to add one.
Otherwise, check application log file/Message traffic.</p>

<p>Item 1.5
Divide data into dimension and fact tables: 90% of the time the division is obvious.</p>

<pre><code>* Dimensions: static entities in the environment
* 
    * Text descriptions are obvious data going into dimension

* Facts: numeric observations/measurements.
* 
    * Unpredictable, numeric numbers are the usual suspects.
</code></pre>

<p>Grain of fact table = a measurement in physical, real-world.</p>

<p>Design steps:</p>

<pre><code>* Determine the single physical event you want to record -&gt; fact table. Other details will follow in dimension tables.
* 
    * What event is a single row in fact table representing? E.g. for fact_sale_event, the grain is literally the beep of the scanner.

* Strive to make facts additive.
* 
    * E.g.: Sale event can go into fact table as (price, unit), but the information (sale amount, unit) contains the same information but better since sale amount (aka extended price) = price * unit.

* Some data can be in both. The goal is ease of use, not methodology correctness.
* 
    * E.g.: Coverage amount of insurance policies can be in both dim_coverage and fact_sale_event. 
</code></pre>

<p>Item 1.6
Bus matrix to communicate/manage dimension tables.</p>

<p>TODO: Table of bus matrix</p>

<p>Item 1.8 Slow Changing Dimensions
Type 0: Constant. Ignore changes.
Type 1: Simple overwrite (best used for error correction).
Type 2: Create another row and save history.
The standard implementation is: surrogate key (PK), durable ID, … attributes …, effective_start_date, effective_end_date, change_reason, current_flag.</p>

<p>Type 3: Create another column for alternate info.</p>

<p>Item 1.10. Fact tables
Data warehouse is built on fact tables expressed at the lowest possible grain.
Higher grain aggregated tables such as category sales by district.
Three kinds of fact tables:</p>

<pre><code>1. Transaction Grain: corresponds to a measurement taken at a single instant.
    1. Unpredictably sparse or dense.
    2. Can be enormous. Cannot guarantee all possible foreign keys represented.
    3. E.g.: fact_qbo_subscription_event

2. Periodic Snapshot Grain: corresponds to a predefined span of time.
    1. Predictably dense.
    2. Can be large even there is no activity.
    3. E.g.: Account balance for an account at some time.

3. Accumulating Snapshot Grain.
    1. Fact entries are overwritten and udpated.
    2. E.g.: Order processing
</code></pre>

<p>Surrogate Keys (integer key, assigned in sequence) are recommended for Fact tables.
In Vertica, CREATE SEQUENCE.</p>

<p>Item 4.1
Too smart interviewers make it harder to extract requirements from business:</p>

<pre><code>* Long-winded questions
* Even worse, some questions box the interviewee into a corner because of some bias. And the interviewees do not know how to get out.
* 
    * Just ask and listen. Let them guide you step by step.
</code></pre>

<p>Item 5.1-5.3: Compare normalized modeling (3NF) vs dimensional modeling (DM)
Why dimensional modeling over normalized modeling?</p>

<pre><code>1. Normalized modeling is intended for transactional databases, making update and delete efficient. It’s not needed in BI/DW.
2. Normalized modeling for a complex business process will result in a very large ER diagram (similar to US cities-freeway maps). Business users cannot simply use that diagram to query what they need to know.
    1. The result ER is usually overwhelming and cannot be viewed in its entirety.
    2. E.g.: How to drive from SJ to NY? Maybe going to Sacramento through 580, then to Salt Lake City, and then what? Similarly, you need to know which table to join.
    3. In the same analogy, it’s actually worse to join the tables since the tables are not static, they are moving cities.
</code></pre>

<p>Dimensional Modeling: top-down design process.</p>

<pre><code>* each fact table represents a business process.
* Support two operations: browse and multi-table joins.
* It is important to keep the dimension tables flat, without being normalized into snowflake structure.
</code></pre>

<h4>Object oriented programming</h4>

<ol>
<li>What is OOP? What is abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism?</li>
</ol>


<h3>Answers</h3>

<h4>Others</h4>

<p>(3) Given 2 sorted arrays, how do I get the median of the combined 2 arrays?</p>

<p>The basic idea is that if you are given two arrays A and B and know the length of each, you can check whether an element A[i] is the median in constant time. Suppose that the median is A[i].
Since the array is sorted, it is greater than exactly i − 1 values in array A.
Then if it is the median, it is also greater than exactly j = ceil(n/2) − (i − 1) elements in B.
It requires constant time to check if B[j] &lt;= A[i] &lt;= B[j + 1].
If A[i] is not the median, then depending on whether A[i] is greater or less than B[j] and B[j + 1], you know that A[i] is either greater than or less than the median.
Thus you can binary search for A[i] in O(lg n) worst-case time.</p>

<p>(4) Given a sorted array and a number k, find 2 number a, b such that a + b = k.</p>

<p>Time O(n) and O(n) for sorted and unsorted array.
a) If the array is sorted, use two pointers at the two ends of the aray.
b) If the array is not sorted, create a hash table with keys as (k-a[i]). Then look up for each a[i] in the table. Table insertion and table look-up is O(1).</p>

<h4>OOP</h4>

<p>(1) What is OOP?</p>

<ul>
<li>OOP: a programming paradigm that uses objects to design computer applications. Here, objects are special data structures that consist of data fields and methods interacting with those data fields. OOP techniques includes the followings: data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, messaging.</li>
<li>Data abstraction: means that we interact with data in objects using its abstract interface. For example, we access private data of an object using its public methods. It is a mechanism to restrict the access to some of data structure&rsquo;s component, usually to separate the implementation details of the data structure.</li>
<li>Encapsulation: in simple definition, the implementation details of a program is separated from its representation. It means that we separate &ldquo;what an object can do&rdquo; and &ldquo;how the object do it&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Inheritance: is the ability of a class to expand as a subclass, so that the code can be reused.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: is the ability of a class can be considered as different forms.</li>
<li>Message passing: in OOP, a message is the single means to pass control to an object. Alan Kay has argued that message passing is more important than objects in OOP, and that objects themselves are often over-emphasized.</li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, from my experience, MySQL is often used as the sandbox for SQL code challenges and interviews.
If you are used to work with Vertica SQL, writing SQL statements in MySQL can be challenging exercises, NOT necessarily in a good way, because many useful features are not supported.</p>

write a function that return the given <code>n</code>-th highest salary. The solution (without using <code>DENSE_RANK</code>) is:</p>

<pre><code class="sql What actually works">CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      -- Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT MAX(Salary)
            FROM Employee Emp1
            WHERE (N-1) = (
                 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Emp2.Salary))
                        FROM Employee Emp2
                        WHERE Emp2.Salary &gt; Emp1.Salary)
  );
END
</code></pre>

<h3>Analytic functions <code>ROW_NUMBER</code>, <code>RANK</code>, and <code>DENSE_RANK</code></h3>

<p>Summary from <a href="http://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/08/17/analytic-functions-in-mysql/">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="sql ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK functions in MySQL">-- In Vertica
SELECT
ROW_NUMBER () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS row_number,
RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS rank,
DENSE_RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY col_1, col_2 ORDER BY col_3 DESC) AS dense_rank,
t.*
FROM table_1 t

-- In MySQL
SELECT
@row_num:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2, @row_num+1, 1) AS row_number,
@rank:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2 AND @prev_col_3=col_3, @rank, @row_num) AS rank,
@dense:=IF(@prev_col_1=t.col_1 AND @prev_col_2=t.col_2, IF(@prev_col_3=col_3, @dense, @dense+1), 1) AS dense_rank,
@prev_col_1 = t.col_1,
@prev_col_2 = t.col_2,
@prev_col_3 = t.col_3,
t.*
FROM (SELECT * FROM table_1 ORDER BY col_1, col_2, col_3 DESC) t,
     (SELECT @row_num:=1, @dense:=1, @rank:=1, @prev_col_1:=NULL, @prev_col_2:=NULL, @prev_col_3:=NULL) var
</code></pre>

<p>In the following <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/">question</a>, note that the outer SELECT is used to only expose only columns of interest while the main SQL code is enclosed in a subquery:</p>

<pre><code class="sql Solution in Vertica SQL">select Score,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS Rank
FROM Scores;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="sql Solution in MySQL">SELECT Score, Rank FROM
( SELECT t.Score,
@dense:=IF(@prev_col2=t.Score, @dense, @dense+1) AS Rank,
@prev_col2:=t.Score
FROM (SELECT Score FROM Scores ORDER BY Score DESC) t,
(SELECT @dense:=0, @prev_col2:=NULL) var ) x
</code></pre>

<h3>Other tricky questions</h3>

<p><code>DELETE</code> might not work as you think in MySQL.</p>

<p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/">Question</a>:
Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named <code>Person</code>, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.</p>

<pre><code class="sql What you might come up">delete from Person
where Id not in (select min(Id) from Person group by Email);
</code></pre>

<p>The above does not work because you need to assign name to the subquery (temporary table).</p>

<pre><code class="sql What actually works">delete from Person
where Id not in
(select * from
(select min(Id) from Person group by Email) x);
</code></pre>

<h3>Answers</h3>

<h4>Question 1</h4>

<p>The sandbox uses MySQL which does not support WITH clause.
See more MySQL workaround in <a href="/blog/2016/08/28/mysql-workaround/">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="sql Answer 1">WITH dept_total AS (
select department_id, sum(salary) as total
from employees
group by department_id
having total &gt; 40000
)
select d.name, t.total
from dept_total t
join deparments d on t.department_id = d.id
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="sql MySQL Answer 1">select d.name, t.total
from (
  select department_id, sum(salary) as total
from employees
group by department_id
having total &gt; 40000
  ) t
  join departments d ON t.department_id = d.id
</code></pre>
