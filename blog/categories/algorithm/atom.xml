<h3>Graph traversals</h3>

<h4>BFS</h4>

<pre><code class="python Book version">def BFS(g:Graph, s:Vertex, discovered):
    """ BFS traversal of the undiscovered portion of Graph g starting at vertex s.

    :param g: give Graph
    :param s: starting Vertex
    :param discovered: Mapping each vertex to the edge used to discover it.
    :return:
    """
    level = [s]

    while len(level) &gt; 0:
        next_level = []
        for v in level:
            for e in g.incident_edges(v):
                u = e.opposite(v)
                if u not in discovered:
                    discovered[u] = e
                    next_level.append(u)

        level = next_level
</code></pre>

<h3>Transitive Closure</h3>

<p>Background: If the graph representation is adjacency list or adjacency map, we can answer the question of reachability for any u and v in <code>O(n+m)</code> (where <code>n</code> is the number of nodes, <code>m</code> is the number of edges).
However, if you have to answer <strong>many</strong> reachability queries (e.g., navigation application), it is better to construct a transitive closure for that graph.</p>

<p>A transitive closure <code>G'</code> is for a directed graph <code>G</code>: any u and v that are reachable, there is an edge (u, v) in <code>G’</code>.</p>

<p>In the classic adjacency list or adjacency map representation, transitive closure can be constructed in <code>O(n(n+m))</code> by repeating DFS at each vertex.
However, when the graph is dense (m -> n<sup>2</sup>), you is better off with Floyd-Warshall algorithm <code>O(n^3)</code> using <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> representation.
Floyd-Warshall requires get_edge and insert_edge to be done in <code>O(1)</code> time, which necessitates adjacency matrix requirements.</p>

<p>In theory, <code>O(n^3)</code> is not better than repeated DFS traversals <code>O(n(n+m))</code>.
However, in practice, Floyd-Warshall is faster and easier to implement because there are fewer low-level operations.
However, when the graph is sparse, repeated DFS traversal approach is better in time and space complexity.</p>

<pre><code class="python Floyd-Warshall implementation">def floyd_warshall(g:Graph) -&gt; Graph:
    """ Return a new graph that is the transite closure of g.

    :param g: input graph
    :return: the transitive closure of g.
    """
    closure = deepcopy(g)
    verts = list(closure.vertices())
    n = len(verts)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            # verify that edge(i, k) exists in the partial closure
            if i != k and closure.get_edge(verts[i], verts[k]) is not None:
                for j in range(n):
                    # verify that edge(k, j) exists in the partial closure
                    if i != j != k and closure.get_edge(verts[k], verts[j]) is not None:
                        if closure.get_edge(verts[i], verts[j]) is None:
                            # if (i, j) not yet included, add it to the closure
                            closure.insert_edge(verts[i], verts[j])

    return closure
</code></pre>

<h3>DAG and topological sorting.</h3>

<p>A directed graph may have more than one topological ordering.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Proposition</strong>: A directed graph has a topological sorting if and only if it is acyclic.</p></blockquote>

<pre><code class="python Topological sorting">def topological_sort(g: Graph) -&gt; list:
    """ Return a list of vertices of DAG in topological order

    :param g: a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
    :return: list of topological sort
    """
    topo = []
    ready = []
    incount = {}

    for u in g.vertices():
        incount[u] = g.degree(u, False)
        if incount[u] == 0:
            # u is free of constraints
            ready.append(u)

    while len(ready) &gt; 0:
        u = ready.pop()
        topo.append(u)

        for e in g.incident_edges(u):
            v = e.opposite(u)
            incount[v] -= 1
            if incount[v] == 0:
                ready.append(v)

    return topo
</code></pre>

<h3>Shortest Paths</h3>

<p>We have a few choices for implementing &ldquo;adaptable priority queue with location-aware entries&rdquo; (at least <code>remove_min</code> required) in Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unsorted sequence implementation -> <code>O(n^2 +m)</code> runtime.</li>
<li>A heap implementation -> <code>O( (n+m)log(n) )</code> runtime.</li>
<li>Fibonacci heap implementation -> <code>O(m +nlog(n))</code> runtime.</li>
</ul>


<p>The &ldquo;heap implementation&rdquo; is &ldquo;AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue&rdquo; class from the chapter 9 of the same textbook.
The &ldquo;Unsorted sequence implementation&rdquo; is implemented as follows, using the same signature of the above class for later compatibility:</p>

<pre><code class="python Simple Adaptable Priority Queue implementation">class AdaptableUnsortedPriorityQueue():
    """ Mocking AdaptableHeapPriorityQueue.
    loc =&gt; key in internal map
    key, val =&gt; value in internal map
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._map = {}

    def add(self, key, value):
        """Add a key-value pair."""
        self._map[value] = (key, value)
        return value

    def update(self, loc, newkey, newval):
        """Update the key and value for the entry"""
        self._map[loc] = (newkey, newval)

    def is_empty(self):
        return (len(self._map) == 0)

    def remove_min(self):

        min_key = float('inf')
        min_loc = None
        min_return = None

        for loc, val in self._map.items():
            if val[0] &lt; min_key:
                min_key = val[0]
                min_loc = loc
                min_return = val

        del self._map[min_loc]
        return min_return
</code></pre>

<p>Python implementation of Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm is shown below.
Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm is analogous to a weighted BFS traversal.
A few assumptions must be true in this implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Theoretical requirement: All the weights are nonnegative.</li>
<li><code>e.element()</code> returns the weight of the edge.</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="python Dijkstra's algorithm">def shortest_path_lengths(g:Graph, s:Vertex):
    """ Compute shortest-path distances from src to reachable vertices of g.
    Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding shortest paths.

    :param g: directed or undirected Graph. e.element() must return non-negative weight
    :param s: Starting vertex
    :return: dictionary mapping each reachable vertex to its distance from s.
    """

    d = {}      # d[v] is upper bound from s to v
    cloud = {}  # map reachable v to its d[v] value
    pq = AdaptableUnsortedPriorityQueue()   # vertex v will have key d[v]
    pqlocator = {}      # map from vertex to its pq locator

    for v in g.vertices():
        if v is s:
            d[v] = 0
        else:
            d[v] = float('inf')

        pqlocator[v] = pq.add(d[v], v)

    while not pq.is_empty():
        key, u = pq.remove_min()
        cloud[u] = key

        for e in g.incident_edges(u):
            v = e.opposite(u)
            if v not in cloud:
                wgt = e.element()
                if d[u] + wgt &lt; d[v]:
                    d[v] = d[u] + wgt
                    pq.update(pqlocator[v], d[v], v)

    return cloud
</code></pre>

<p>Then, based on the returned computed shortest-path distances, we can compute <strong>shortest-path tree</strong>.
We use the same data structure that represents <strong>DFS tree</strong> and <strong>BFS tree</strong>: a map that maps a vertex to its discovery edge (edge connecting to its parent).
Because of using the same data structure, you can reuse the method <code>construct_path</code> to compute the path from one vertex to another.</p>

<pre><code class="python Compute shortest path tree">def shortest_path_tree(g: Graph, s: Vertex, d:dict) -&gt; dict:
    """ Reconstruct shortest-path tree rooted at vertex s, given the distance map d.
    Return tree as a map from vertex v -&gt; discovery edge.

    :param g: Given graph, directed or undirected.
    :param s: starting vertex.
    :param d: distance map, created from Dijkstra's algorithm.
    :return:
    """
    tree = {}

    for v in d:
        if v is not s:
            for e in g.incident_edges(v, False):
                u = e.opposite(v)
                wgt = e.element()
                if d[v] == d[u] + wgt:
                    tree[v] = e

    return tree
</code></pre>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<pre><code class="python Example usage">def test_dijkstra_algorithm(self):
    g = ExampleGraphs.airport_graph()

    vertex_map = {v.element() : v for v in g.vertices()}
    starting_vertex = vertex_map["JFK"]

    cloud = shortest_path_lengths(g, starting_vertex)

    for k, v in cloud.items():
        print("%s: %s"% (k,v))

    sp_tree = shortest_path_tree(g, starting_vertex, cloud)
    path = construct_path(vertex_map["JFK"], vertex_map["LAX"], sp_tree)

    print("Shortest path from JFK to LAX")
    for ap in path:
        print(str(ap))
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="plain Example output">Shortest path from JFK to LAX
[Vertex: JFK]
[Vertex: ORD]
[Vertex: DFW]
[Vertex: LAX]

<h3>Answers</h3>

<h4>Others</h4>

<p>(3) Given 2 sorted arrays, how do I get the median of the combined 2 arrays?</p>

<p>The basic idea is that if you are given two arrays A and B and know the length of each, you can check whether an element A[i] is the median in constant time. Suppose that the median is A[i].
Since the array is sorted, it is greater than exactly i − 1 values in array A.
Then if it is the median, it is also greater than exactly j = ceil(n/2) − (i − 1) elements in B.
It requires constant time to check if B[j] &lt;= A[i] &lt;= B[j + 1].
If A[i] is not the median, then depending on whether A[i] is greater or less than B[j] and B[j + 1], you know that A[i] is either greater than or less than the median.
Thus you can binary search for A[i] in O(lg n) worst-case time.</p>

<p>(4) Given a sorted array and a number k, find 2 number a, b such that a + b = k.</p>

<p>Time O(n) and O(n) for sorted and unsorted array.
a) If the array is sorted, use two pointers at the two ends of the aray.
b) If the array is not sorted, create a hash table with keys as (k-a[i]). Then look up for each a[i] in the table. Table insertion and table look-up is O(1).</p>

<h4>OOP</h4>

<p>(1) What is OOP?</p>

<ul>
<li>OOP: a programming paradigm that uses objects to design computer applications. Here, objects are special data structures that consist of data fields and methods interacting with those data fields. OOP techniques includes the followings: data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, messaging.</li>
<li>Data abstraction: means that we interact with data in objects using its abstract interface. For example, we access private data of an object using its public methods. It is a mechanism to restrict the access to some of data structure&rsquo;s component, usually to separate the implementation details of the data structure.</li>
<li>Encapsulation: in simple definition, the implementation details of a program is separated from its representation. It means that we separate &ldquo;what an object can do&rdquo; and &ldquo;how the object do it&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Inheritance: is the ability of a class to expand as a subclass, so that the code can be reused.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: is the ability of a class can be considered as different forms.</li>
<li>Message passing: in OOP, a message is the single means to pass control to an object. Alan Kay has argued that message passing is more important than objects in OOP, and that objects themselves are often over-emphasized.</li>

<h3>Answers</h3>

<p>(1) <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4068033/add-two-integers-using-only-bitwise-operators">Addition</a>: Recursive formula <code>x + y = (x ^ y) + (x &amp; y) &lt;&lt; 1</code> is the most easy to understand.
In code, it is implemented as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="java Addition">    private int add(int a, int b) {
        if(b == 0)
            return a;

        return add( a ^ b, (a &amp; b) &lt;&lt; 1);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>(2) <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subtract-two-numbers-without-using-arithmetic-operators/">Subtraction</a>: The recursive formula is <code>x - y = (x ^ y) - (~x &amp; y) &lt;&lt; 1</code>.
In code, it is implemented as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="java Subtraction">    private int subtract(int a, int b) {
        if(b == 0)
            return a;

        return subtract( a ^ b, (~a &amp; b) &lt;&lt; 1);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>(3) Find odd one.</p>

<p>XOR all the values of the array together. <code>a XOR a = 0</code>.</p>

<p>(4) Quickly determine if a number is a power of 2.</p>

<p>If x == 0, return False. Then, check <code>x &amp; (x-1) == 0</code>.</p>

<p>(5) Big-endian stores the most significant byte first, while little-endian stores the least significant byte first.
Fields in the protocols of the Internet protocol suite, such as IPv4, IPv6, TCP, and UDP, are transmitted in big-endian order.
For this reason, big-endian byte order is also referred to as network byte order.</p>

<p>(6) Use union type in C. Then check it based on definition.</p>

<pre><code class="c Check endianess">union Data
{
int i;
char str[2];
} data;

data.i = 0x00ff;
printf( "data.str[0]: %d\n", data.str[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>Or use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/htonl"><code>htonl</code></a> function (Host TO Network Long) in Linux.
If outputs are the same as inputs, it is big-endian since data is transmitted in big-endian order in many Internet protocols.</p>

<h3>Common NP-complete problems</h3>

<p>The most classic ones that you should know are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems">these NP-complete problems</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>[Satisfiability]</strong>: the boolean satisfiability problem for
formulas in [conjunctive normal form] (often referred to as SAT)

<ul>
<li><strong>[0&ndash;1 integer programming]</strong> (A variation in which only the
restrictions must be satisfied, with no optimization)</li>
<li><strong>[Clique]</strong> (see also [independent set problem])

<ul>
<li><strong>[Set packing]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[Vertex cover]</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>[Set covering]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[Feedback node set]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[Feedback arc set]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[Directed Hamilton cycle]</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>[Undirected Hamilton cycle]</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>[Satisfiability with at most 3 literals per clause]</strong>
(equivalent to 3-SAT)

<ul>
<li><strong>[Chromatic number]</strong> (also called the [Graph Coloring
Problem])

<ul>
<li><strong>[Clique cover]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[Exact cover]</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>[Hitting set]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[Steiner tree]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[3-dimensional matching]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[Knapsack]</strong> (Karp&rsquo;s definition of Knapsack is
closer to [Subset sum])

<ul>
<li><strong>[Job sequencing]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[Partition]</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>[Max cut]</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Their relations are discussed in the Karp&rsquo;s paper.</p>

<h3>Other related concepts</h3>

<p>Pseudo-polynomial solution: the complexity depends on the <em>value</em> of the input, instead of the <em>length</em> of the input.</p>

<p>Difference between <em>value</em> and <em>length</em> of the input: an integer N has its <em>length</em> at <code>O(log(N))</code>, no matter what base it is using.
Therefore, an algorithm that is polynomial to the <em>value</em> of the input is actually exponential to the size of the input.</p>

<h4>Subset sum</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem">Subset Sum problem</a> is this: given a set (or multiset) of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero (or some value)?
The problem is NP-complete, meaning roughly that while it is easy to confirm whether a proposed solution is valid, it may inherently be prohibitively difficult to determine in the first place whether any solution exists.</p>

<p>The Dynamic Programming solution below runs in pseudo-polynomial time.
As mentioned above, it means that the complexity is actually exponential.</p>

<pre><code class="python">def subset_sum(values: list, total: int) -&gt; bool:
    """ Given an array of non-negative numbers and a total, is there a way to add up those numbers to the total.

    :param values: array of non-negative numbers
    :param total: target total
    :return: True if possible
    """

    n = len(values)
    check = [[False] * (total+1) for _ in range(n+1)]

    # if sum == 0, it is True no matter how many in the set
    for i in range(n+1):
        check[i][0] = True

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, total+1):
            if j &lt; values[i-1]:
                check[i][j] = check[i-1][j]
            else:
                check[i][j] = check[i-1][j] or check[i-1][j - values[i-1]]

    return check[n][total]

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">Longest Common Subsequence</a></h3>

<p>The longest common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem, the basis of data comparison programs such as the diff utility, and has applications in bioinformatics.
It is also widely used by revision control systems such as Git for reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem can be divided into two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>A DP solution to find the <strong>length</strong> of the longest common subsequence by constructing a 2D matrix.</li>
<li>Tracing that constructed matrix to find the common subsequence.</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="python">def longest_common_subsequence(str1:str, str2:str) -&gt; str:
    if not str1 or not str2:
        return 0

    m = len(str1)
    n = len(str2)
    mtable = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]

    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
                mtable[i][j] = 1 + mtable[i-1][j-1]
            else:
                mtable[i][j] = max(mtable[i-1][j], mtable[i][j-1])

    # return mtable[m][n]
    # We have longest_common_subsequence_length at this point

    subsequence = [""] * mtable[m][n]
    idx = mtable[m][n] - 1

    i = m
    j = n
    while i &gt; 0 and j &gt; 0:
        if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
            # if character matches, add to the array
            subsequence[idx] = str2[j - 1]
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            idx -= 1
        else:
            # else, follow the larger number
            if mtable[i-1][j] &gt; mtable[i][j-1]:
                i -= 1
            else:
                j -= 1

    return "".join(subsequence)
</code></pre>

<p>Some optimization pointers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The matrix in the naive algorithm grows quadratically with the lengths of the sequences.
In most real-world cases, especially source code diffs and patches, the beginnings and ends of files rarely change.
In that case, we can do preprocessing to remove the unchanged portions.</li>
<li>If only the length of the LCS is required, the matrix can be reduced to a <code>2*min(n,m)</code> matrix with ease, or to a <code>min(m,n)+1</code> vector as the DP approach only needs the current and previous columns of the matrix.</li>
</ul>
