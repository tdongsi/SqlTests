<p>== Module  1 ==
Ppl looks for different things in data</p>

<pre><code>* Trend: bar, graph
* Average
</code></pre>

<p>Above all else, show data.
Data-pixel ratio: data pixels/non-data pixels.
How to enhance data-pixel ratio:</p>

<pre><code>* Granularity: depends on the question you want to answer
* 
    * monthly if you want to know monthly sales, daily if you want to know what happens last Tuesday.
    * category or sub-category: you can have category with drill down function.

* Annotation: similar to Granularity. Minimize it to enough to answer the question.
</code></pre>

<p>Tricks &amp; Tips:</p>

<pre><code>* Plots (over Bars): plot show the trends for different components over time.
* Sizing Bars: Preserve True Portions: starting Y from 0.
* 
    * Sizing Bars: shows proportions, relative progression.

* Scatter Plots: show clusters, outliers.
* Radio displays: usually a bad idea. Waste of space, hard to discern between slices.
</code></pre>

<p>== Module 2: Common Charts ==</p>

<p>Basic data Presentation Methods - Chart Types</p>

<pre><code>* Geo-Spatial - Maps: anything related to geographic distribution, i.e., when geography matters. e.g. real estates, oil industry.
* Correlation - Scatter Plots: two measurements (e.g., sales to profit).
* Hierarchical - Drill down Tree: data is hierarchical: Category -&gt; Subcateogries.
* Categorical - Bar Charts: comparing categories (sales by region)
* Time Series - Line Charts: progression over time. (sales by month)
* 
    * NOT: Area Charts.

* Distribution - Histograms: Trying to answer what is “normal”. e.g., home prices, salaries.
</code></pre>

<p>Others</p>

<pre><code>* Box plot: distribution, percentiles, median in 1 chart.
* Bullet graph: actuals to target. Invented by Stephen Few.
* 
    * Dark bar is actual, reference line is target. Color code bands are average, good, bad target range.
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_graph

* Sparkline: Multiple line charts. Best used for monitoring dashboard.
* Heat map: Large combinations of dimensions. Color is everything here.
</code></pre>

<p>Charts to avoid</p>

<pre><code>* Pie charts: angles make it hard to compare. Usually decorative, not informative. Space is wasted.
* Polar charts
* Stacked area charts:
* 
    * Only tell the story of the bottom line and the total. Anything in between, you can’t really tell if they are growing or not.
    * Misleading/Confusing: is the top the total or another category?
</code></pre>

<p>== Module 3: Dashboard planning ==</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<pre><code>* User Request
* Prioritization
* Planning
* Design
* Development
* Delivery to User
</code></pre>

<p>== Module 4: Dashboard design ==</p>

<p>Audience is King. Know your audience.</p>

<pre><code>* Who is using it? 
* Are they technical or prefer dumbed down answers? Are they intimate with data?
* What is primary objective? What questions that they try to answer? What questions this dashboard MUST answer?
* What impact of the answer? How will they use metrics? (Role, what decisions they make)
* When will the dashboard is used? (Weekly? Daily?) Dashboard is exploratory or explanatory?
* What level of confidence in data sources?
</code></pre>

<p>Dashboard layout: F layout is the most natural for web/desktop viewing.</p>

<p>== Module 5 &amp; 6: Tableau ==</p>

<p>Connecting to Data:
You can connect to Excel, text file (csv or tab), or HP Vertica.
You can specify data import like Excel or using Custom SQL.
After importing, Tableau may import all data into its own internal data engine (with compression, data reorganization easier for analytics).
It also divides data into dimensions and measures.
Dimensions are further categorized into: geographic (e.g., region, postal code), number, text, date (e.g., calendar, order_date).
Facts are usually numbers but it can be other categories: e.g., geographic for latitude/longitude measures.</p>

<p>Dimensions: context for analysis
Facts (Measures):</p>

<p>Visualizing data:
Tableau has “Show Me” button that gives suggestions for different combinations of dimensions and fact data.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From Kimball group reader.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Design items:
You need to do data profiling to keep data processed to min. One way to profile data changes is to use CDC column.
Check CDC columns: e.g. last_update_ts. If CDC columns are not available, work with production system DBA to add one.
Otherwise, check application log file/Message traffic.</p>

<p>Item 1.5
Divide data into dimension and fact tables: 90% of the time the division is obvious.</p>

<pre><code>* Dimensions: static entities in the environment
* 
    * Text descriptions are obvious data going into dimension

* Facts: numeric observations/measurements.
* 
    * Unpredictable, numeric numbers are the usual suspects.
</code></pre>

<p>Grain of fact table = a measurement in physical, real-world.</p>

<p>Design steps:</p>

<pre><code>* Determine the single physical event you want to record -&gt; fact table. Other details will follow in dimension tables.
* 
    * What event is a single row in fact table representing? E.g. for fact_sale_event, the grain is literally the beep of the scanner.

* Strive to make facts additive.
* 
    * E.g.: Sale event can go into fact table as (price, unit), but the information (sale amount, unit) contains the same information but better since sale amount (aka extended price) = price * unit.

* Some data can be in both. The goal is ease of use, not methodology correctness.
* 
    * E.g.: Coverage amount of insurance policies can be in both dim_coverage and fact_sale_event. 
</code></pre>

<p>Item 1.6
Bus matrix to communicate/manage dimension tables.</p>

<p>TODO: Table of bus matrix</p>

<p>Item 1.8 Slow Changing Dimensions
Type 0: Constant. Ignore changes.
Type 1: Simple overwrite (best used for error correction).
Type 2: Create another row and save history.
The standard implementation is: surrogate key (PK), durable ID, … attributes …, effective_start_date, effective_end_date, change_reason, current_flag.</p>

<p>Type 3: Create another column for alternate info.</p>

<p>Item 1.10. Fact tables
Data warehouse is built on fact tables expressed at the lowest possible grain.
Higher grain aggregated tables such as category sales by district.
Three kinds of fact tables:</p>

<pre><code>1. Transaction Grain: corresponds to a measurement taken at a single instant.
    1. Unpredictably sparse or dense.
    2. Can be enormous. Cannot guarantee all possible foreign keys represented.
    3. E.g.: fact_qbo_subscription_event

2. Periodic Snapshot Grain: corresponds to a predefined span of time.
    1. Predictably dense.
    2. Can be large even there is no activity.
    3. E.g.: Account balance for an account at some time.

3. Accumulating Snapshot Grain.
    1. Fact entries are overwritten and udpated.
    2. E.g.: Order processing
</code></pre>

<p>Surrogate Keys (integer key, assigned in sequence) are recommended for Fact tables.
In Vertica, CREATE SEQUENCE.</p>

<p>Item 4.1
Too smart interviewers make it harder to extract requirements from business:</p>

<pre><code>* Long-winded questions
* Even worse, some questions box the interviewee into a corner because of some bias. And the interviewees do not know how to get out.
* 
    * Just ask and listen. Let them guide you step by step.
</code></pre>

<p>Item 5.1-5.3: Compare normalized modeling (3NF) vs dimensional modeling (DM)
Why dimensional modeling over normalized modeling?</p>

<pre><code>1. Normalized modeling is intended for transactional databases, making update and delete efficient. It’s not needed in BI/DW.
2. Normalized modeling for a complex business process will result in a very large ER diagram (similar to US cities-freeway maps). Business users cannot simply use that diagram to query what they need to know.
    1. The result ER is usually overwhelming and cannot be viewed in its entirety.
    2. E.g.: How to drive from SJ to NY? Maybe going to Sacramento through 580, then to Salt Lake City, and then what? Similarly, you need to know which table to join.
    3. In the same analogy, it’s actually worse to join the tables since the tables are not static, they are moving cities.
</code></pre>

<p>Dimensional Modeling: top-down design process.</p>

<pre><code>* each fact table represents a business process.
* Support two operations: browse and multi-table joins.
* It is important to keep the dimension tables flat, without being normalized into snowflake structure.
</code></pre>

<h3>Answers</h3>

<h4>Section A</h4>

<p>(1) See more <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/190014/htg-explains-what-is-the-difference-between-tcp-and-udp/">here</a>.
Both TCP and UDP are protocols used for sending packets over Internet.
Built on top of Internet Protocol (IP). The packets are sent to an IP address.</p>

<p>TCP: Transmission Control Protocol</p>

<ol>
<li>Two ways: the remote system sends packets back to acknowledge it’s received your packets.</li>
<li>TCP guarantees the recipient will receive the packets in order by numbering them.</li>
<li>TCP is about reliability: if ACK is not received, the sender will send packets again.</li>
<li>Example usage: file download, web.</li>
</ol>


<p>UDP: User Datagram Protocol</p>

<ol>
<li>Just send the packets to receiver. No waiting for ACK.</li>
<li>No guarantee: if receivers don’t receive it, too bad.</li>
<li>No error checking for better performance.</li>
<li>Example usage: game, live video stream.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Section B</h4>

<p>(3) See more <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/107390/whats-the-difference-between-a-post-and-a-put-http-request">here</a>.</p>

<p>PUT is idempotent: multiple PUT requests will have the same effect. POST is not.
To give examples of REST-style resources:
&ldquo;POST /books&rdquo; with a bunch of book information might create a new book, and respond with the new URL identifying that book: &ldquo;/books/5&rdquo;.
&ldquo;PUT /books/5&rdquo; would have to either create a new book with the id of 5, or replace the existing book with ID 5.</p>

<p>In non-resource style, POST can be used for just about anything that has a side effect. One other difference is that PUT should be idempotent - multiple PUTs of the same data to the same URL should be fine, wheras multiple POSTs might create multiple objects or whatever it is your POST action does.</p>

<h3>Answer keys</h3>

<h4>Section A</h4>

<p>(1) <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins.html</a></p>

<h3>Section B</h3>

<p>(1) Normalizing: remove redundancy -> remove update and delete anomaly -> more efficient data storage and consistent data.</p>

<p>Summary from Introduction to Databases
To reduce redundancy. From redundancy, it will lead to update and delete anomaly.
E.g.: dim_company: region/country info will be repeated -> redundancy.
E.g.: North Korea and South Korea merged into Korea -> delete those regions will delete companies -> delete anomaly.</p>

<p>Popular normal forms:</p>

<p>BCNF: For each functional dependency A-> B, A is key.
Functional dependency: A -> B: same A leads to same B. E.g.: ID -> name.</p>

<p>4NF: Functional dependency + Multivalued dependency.
Multivalued dependency: A ->> B, C: each A lead to all combo (B x C). E.g.: ID -> region x language
4NF: For each multivalued dependency A ->> B, C, A is key. I.e.: (A, B, C) is decomposed to (A, B) and (A, C).</p>

<p>(2) When there is no data update or deletion. For example: data warehouse situations.
Analytical processing: joining multiple tables is not efficient. The SQL queries are hard to write.</p>

<p>(3)Why is transaction is important:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concurrency: Ensure consistent data read/write while providing concurrent data access.</li>
<li>Failure-tolerance: Resilience to system failures.</li>
</ul>


<p>A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements treated as a unit. The effect of a transaction is either full or none at all.
Transactions appear to run in isolation.</p>

<p>ACID: atomic, consistency, isolation, durability</p>

<p>(4) You have a foreign key, reference to another table.
When that key is deleted from the other table, referential integrity is compromised.</p>

<p>(5) Check current state: hang processes, long running queries.
Optimize SQL queries.
Indexes.</p>

<p>(6) What is it: persistent data structure, stored in database.
Purpose: improve data lookup performance.
Instead of scanning a whole relational table for a record, using the index, the location of a record can be returned almost immediately.
Implementation: Balanced trees (B tree, B+ tree), Hash Map (for equality condition only)</p>

<p>A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure.
An index is a copy of select columns of data from a table that can be searched very efficiently that also includes a low-level disk block address or direct link to the complete row of data it was copied from.</p>

<p>(7) OLTP: Suppose your query is correct, and does not return any duplicates, then including DISTINCT simply forces the RDBMS to check your result (zero benefit, and a lot of additional processing).
Suppose your query is incorrect, and does return duplicates, then including DISTINCT simply hides the problem (again with additional processing).
It would be better to spot the problem and fix your query.
It&rsquo;ll run faster that way.</p>

Topics in this chapter are the most intensive and frequently asked during interviews.</p>

<p>This chapter discuss how to prevent concurrent access to shared data that may result in data inconsistency.</p>

<h3>5.1 &amp; 5.2: Critical section</h3>

<p>Consider the producer–consumer problem, which is representative of
operating systems. Specifically, in Section 3.4.1, we described how a bounded
buffer could be used to enable processes to share memory.</p>

<p>The above code works incorrectly in multi-thread or process situation, due to parallel modifications to &ldquo;counter&rdquo;.
When several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently and the
outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access
takes place, is called a race condition.</p>

<p>Critical section: No two processes are executing in their critical sections at the same time.
Solution to a critical section problem requires:
Mutual exclusion: only one process in CS at a time.
Progress: Selection process should not be postponed indefinitely.
Bounded waiting: once a process request to enter, waiting time is bounded.</p>

<p>Nonpreemptive kernel does not allow a process running in kernel mode to be
preempted; a kernel-mode process will run until it exits kernel mode, blocks,
or voluntarily yields control of the CPU. A nonpreemptive kernel is essentially free from race conditions.
A preemptive kernel may be more responsive, since there is less risk that a
kernel-mode process will run for an arbitrarily long period.</p>

<p>NOTE: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson's_algorithm">Peterson’s algorithm</a> is restricted to two processes.
Filter algorithm: Peterson&rsquo;s algorithm for N processes
The filter algorithm generalizes Peterson&rsquo;s algorithm for N processes. It uses N different levels - each represents another &lsquo;waiting room&rsquo;, before the critical section. Each level will allow at least one process to advance, while keeping one process in waiting.</p>

<p><a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12621/understanding-peterson-s-and-dekker-s-algorithms">http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12621/understanding-peterson-s-and-dekker-s-algorithms</a>
Both processes indicates if the other want to enter CS, it can proceed. If both processes enter at the same time, turn will be set to i and j at the same time, and only one will last.
Proof of bounded waiting: Pi will enter the CS after at most one entry by Pj.</p>

<h3>5.4: Sync using hardware</h3>

<p>Protect critical section by locking.</p>

<p>Many modern computer systems therefore provide special hardware
instructions that allow us either to test and modify the content of a word or
to swap the contents of two words atomically—that is, as one uninterruptible unit.</p>

<p>Atomic test_and_set() and compare_and_swap() for locking:</p>

<p>boolean test_and_set(boolean <em>target) {
boolean rv = </em>target;
*target = true;
return rv;
}</p>

<p>int compare_and_swap(int <em>value, int expected, int new value) {
int temp = </em>value;
if (<em>value == expected)
    </em>value = new value;
return temp;
}</p>

<p>Simple Mutex with atomic test_and_set()
Figure 5.5</p>

<p>Bounded-Waiting mutex with atomic test_and_set(): data structure and algorithm
Figure 5.7</p>

<h3>5.5: Mutex locks</h3>

<p>We use the mutex to lock to protect critical regions and thus prevent race conditions.</p>

<p>Calls to either acquire() or release() must be performed atomically.</p>

<p>acquire() {
while (!available)
; /<em> busy wait </em>/
available = false;
}</p>

<p>release() {
available = true;
}
Usage:</p>

<p>acquire()</p>

<p>// start of CS</p>

<p>// end of CS</p>

<p>release()</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of the implementation given here is that it requires busy waiting. This type of mutex lock is also called a spinlock.
Spinlocks do have an advantage, however, in that no context switch is required.</p>

<h3>5.6: Semaphores</h3>

<p>A semaphore S is an integer variable that, apart from initialization, is
accessed only through two standard atomic operations: wait() and signal().</p>

<p>wait(S) {
while (S &lt;= 0 )
; // busy wait
S&ndash;;
}</p>

<p>signal(S) {
S++;
}</p>

<p>The value of a counting semaphore can range over an unrestricted domain. Versus binary semaphore, which is similar to mutex.
Counting semaphores can be used to control access to a given resources of a finite number of instances.</p>

<p>We can also use semaphores to solve various synchronization problems.
For example,consider two concurrently running processes: P1 with a statement
S1 and P2 with a statement S2 . Suppose we require that S2 be executed only
after S1 has completed. We can implement this scheme readily by letting P1
and P2 share a common semaphore synch, initialized to 0. In process P1 , we
insert the statements
S1;
signal(synch);</p>

<p>In process P2 , we insert the statements
wait(synch);
S 2 ;</p>

<p>Because synch is initialized to 0, P2 will execute S2 only after P1 has invoked
signal(synch) , which is after statement S1 has been executed.</p>

<p>Deadlock:
P 0 P 1
wait(S); wait(Q);
wait(Q); wait(S);
. .
. .
. .
signal(S); signal(Q);
signal(Q); signal(S);</p>

<p>Priority inversion:
The problem of priority inversion is when three processes of different priorities L &lt; M &lt; H. H is waiting for L to finish with a certain resource. M process becomes runnable and preempts L. Indirectly, process M with lower priority affects how long process H must wait for resource.
It occurs when the system has more than two priorities. However, it is almost always the case.
Solution: priority-inheritance protocol: all processes that use a resource, waited by a higher priority process, will inherit the highest priority until they are done with the resource.</p>

<h4>Semaphore implementation</h4>

<p>The naive definition of wait() and signal() above presents the same problem of busy waiting.
In actual implementation, when a process execute wait() operation and find that semaphore value is not positive, it must wait. However, instead of busy waiting, the process block itself.
In this implementation, semaphore values may be negative, while they are never negative in classical definition with busy waiting. If a semaphore value is negative, its magnitude indicates the number of waiting processes (note different order of decrement in wait()).</p>

<p>It is critical that semaphore operations be executed atomically: no two processes can execute wait() and signal() operations on the same semaphore at the same time.
In a multiprocessor environment, usually compare_and_swap() or spin locks are used to ensure wait() and signal() are atomic.
So, we admit that busy waiting is NOT eliminated in this implementation. However, busy waiting is limited to CS of the wait() and signal() operations. These CSs are short (about 10 instructions). Thus, CS is almost never occupied, and busy waiting is rare and short, if ever happens.</p>

<h3>5.7: Classic Problems of Synchronization</h3>

<p>Use semaphores for synchronization. Actual implementation can use mutex instead of binary semaphore.</p>

<p>Bounded-Buffer (Consumer-Producer) problem
Problem: See 5.1.
Solution: The producer and consumer share the following data structure:
The mutex is used to provide mutual exclusion for accesses to the buffer pool.
int n;
semaphore mutex = 1;
semaphore empty = n;
semaphore full = 0</p>

<p>Producer    Consumer
do {
&hellip;
/<em> produce an item in next produced </em>/
&hellip;
wait(empty);
wait(mutex);
&hellip;
/<em> add next produced to the buffer </em>/
&hellip;
signal(mutex);
signal(full);
} while (true);
do {
wait(full);
wait(mutex);
&hellip;
/<em> remove an item from buffer to next consumed </em>/
&hellip;
signal(mutex);
signal(empty);
&hellip;
/<em> consume the item in next consumed </em>/
&hellip;
} while (true);</p>

<p>Reader-Writer problem:
Writers should have exclusive access while writing to the shared database.
There are several variants of “reader-writer” problems:
First problem: No reader to be kept waiting unless a writer has already obtained accesss.
Second problem: Once writer is ready, that writer perform its write ASAP. No new readers may start reading.
A solution to either problem may result in starvation.</p>

<p>Solution to first reader-writer problem: shared data structure
semaphore rw_utex = 1;
semaphore mutex = 1;
int read count = 0;
The mutex semaphore is used to ensure mutual exclusion when the variable read count is updated.
The read count variable keeps track of how many processes are currently reading the object.
The semaphore rw_mutex functions as a mutual exclusion semaphore for the writers.</p>

<p>Writer  Reader
do {
wait(rw mutex);
&hellip;
/<em> writing is performed </em>/
&hellip;
signal(rw mutex);
} while (true);
do {
wait(mutex);
read count++;
if (read count == 1)
wait(rw mutex);
signal(mutex);
&hellip;
/<em> reading is performed </em>/
&hellip;
wait(mutex);
read count&ndash;;
if (read count == 0)
signal(rw mutex);
signal(mutex);
} while (true);</p>

<p>Dining Philosopher problem: This solution can create a deadlock
semaphore chopstick[5];</p>

<p>do {
wait(chopstick[i]);
wait(chopstick[(i+1) % 5]);
&hellip;
/<em> eat for awhile </em>/
&hellip;
signal(chopstick[i]);
signal(chopstick[(i+1) % 5]);
&hellip;
/<em> think for awhile </em>/
&hellip;
} while (true);</p>

<p>Several possible remedies to the deadlock problem are replaced by:
• Allow at most four philosophers to be sitting simultaneously at the table.
• Allow a philosopher to pick up her chopsticks only if both chopsticks are
available (to do this, she must pick them up in a critical section).
• Use an asymmetric solution—that is,an odd-numbered philosopher picks
up first her left chopstick and then her right chopstick, whereas an even-
numbered philosopher picks up her right chopstick and then her left
chopstick.</p>

<p>In 5.8, we use monitor (equivalent to a waiter to tell which philosopher should eat) to provides deadlock-free solution.
A deadlock-free solution does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of starvation.</p>

<h3>5.8: Monitors</h3>

<p>Semaphore is not a complete solution. If a single process is not well-behaved (semaphore used incorrectly), the system break down.
Incorrect order of signal() and wait(): mutual exclusion is no longer guaranteed.
wait() is used in place of signal(): a deadlock may occur.
wait() or signal() or both are omitted: mutual exclusion violated or deadlock.</p>

<p>Syntax of a monitor:</p>

<p>Local variables of a monitor can be accessed by only the local functions. Only one process at a time is active within the monitor.
We also defines condition construct: condition x, y; // condition variables
The only operations that can be invoked on a condition variable are wait() and signal().
The operation x.wait(); means that the process invoking this operation is suspended until another process invokes x.signal();
The x.signal() operation resumes exactly one suspended process. If no process is suspended, then the signal() operation has no effect.
(Different from semaphore’s signal(): semaphore() signal always change the state of semaphore, condition’s signal() may not).</p>

<p>Dining Philosophers solution using Monitors:
Monitor is acting like a waiter/moderator. Before a philosopher starts eating, she informs the waiter (invoked operation pickup()) and the waiter will tell her what to do.
After she is done eating, she again informs the waiter (putdown()). It is still possible that some philosopher will starve to death.</p>

<p>condition self[5];
allows philosopher i to delay herself when she is hungry but is unable to obtain the chopsticks she needs.</p>

<p>Implement a Monitor with Semaphores
Check Section 5.8.3 page 229.</p>

<p>Resuming Processes within a Monitor
One simple solution is to use FIFO ordering.
Another solution is conditional-wait construct, with c is the priority number input.
x.wait&copy;;
When x.signal() is executed, the process with the smallest priority number is resumed next.</p>

<p>Java monitors
Java uses monitor for thread synchronization.
Every object in Java has a single lock associated with it. When a method is declared synchronized, calling the method requires owning the lock of the object.
If the lock is not available, the synchronized method is placed in the entry set for the object’s lock.
The Java Object class’s method wait() and notify() are similar to wait() and signal() statements for a monitor.</p>

<h3>Basic statistics</h3>

<p>Two vectors <strong>x</strong> and <strong>z</strong> is joinly Guassian when the combined vector <strong>y</strong> = [x z] is also Gaussian.
Jointly Gaussian implies marginally Guassian, conditionally Gaussian. The reverse is not true.</p>

<h4>Extended Kalman Filter</h4>

<h3>EKF-SLAM formulation</h3>

<p>TODO</p>

<h3>Mingyang&rsquo;s thesis</h3>

<p>Contributions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Analysis of EKF-SLAM and MSCKF. New estimator (MSCKF 2.0) with correct observability.</li>
<li>Hybrid estimator that picks either EKF-SLAM formulation or MSCKF 2.0, depending on length of feature tracks.</li>

<li>IMU axis misalignment, scale factors, and g-sensitivity affects inertial sensors.</li>
<li>Image distortions from rolling shutter cameras.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p> Why? IMU and cameras are already found in several commercial resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile phones and AR devices).</p>

<h4>Contribution 1: EKF-SLAM and MSCKF -> MSCKF 2.0</h4>

<p>EKF-SLAM formulation: current pose + feature positions.
Since we are not doing mapping, only currently visible features are kept -> computational cost is bounded.</p>

<p>MSCKF: a sliding window of poses.
Measurements are used to impose the constraints on these poses.
If a new feature is found, add a new pose to the state vector and augment covariance matrix accordingly.
Each feature is tracked until it goes out of field of view, then all of its observations are processed at once.
A pose is only removed when all features associated with that pose have been processed.</p>

<p>Consistency and accuracy of estimators are correlated.
A recursive estimator is consistent if the estimation errors are zero-mean and have covariance matrix as reported by the estimator.</p>

<p>Why difference? Assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>In EKF: IMU state and feature positions are jointly Gaussian. With non-linear measurement models, this is a strong assumption.

<ul>
<li>To improve it, need to pick another feature parameterization to make the measurement model closer to linear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In MSCKF, there is no feature positions. No assumptions on feature positions are required.</li>
<li>MSCKF delay linearization: only process each feature when all of its measurement are available -> better estimates -> better Jacobians -> better updates.</li>
<li>In EKF-SLAM, using fewer observations: e.g., in standard XYZ parameterizaton, it can lead to wildly inaccurate estimates.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Contribution 2: Hybrid estimator, pick one</h4>

<ul>
<li>N: number of features.</li>
<li>m: feature length: max number of observations per feature.</li>
</ul>


<p>Then, the compuational costs of the two estimators are</p>

<ul>
<li>MSCKF: O(N) and O(m<sup>3</sup>).</li>
<li>EKF-SLAM: O(N<sup>3</sup>) and O(m).</li>
</ul>


<p>MSCKF is faster because of general distribution of features: because of feature detection algorithms, majority of features are detected close to the camera, where it will goes out of the FOV quickly (large N, small m).
For example, in Cheddar Gorge data, many features are close to the car/camera, while a few are really far away.</p>

<p>Depending on the length of feature tracks in current environment, use one.
Given “many” measurements, nothing is gained by initializing features  observed fewer than m times.
So, if the features is observed less than m times, use MSCKF. Otherwise, put it in the state vector and use EKF-SLAM.
m (sliding window size) is to determined empirically: plotting and see the low points.</p>

<h4>Contribution 3: Online camera-to-IMU calibration</h4>

<p>Detailed identifiability analysis of these parameters.
Time offset between the two measurements.
The degenerate cases are known and rare cases.</p>

<p>Some degenerate cases are: (Recovery?)</p>

<ul>
<li>Going in a straight line</li>
<li>Constant acceleration with no rotation</li>
<li>Constant velocity (no acceleration) with rotation about gravity vector only.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Contribution 4: Models for low-cost sensors</h4>

<p>Measurement models for rolling shutter camera.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is OOP? What is abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism?</li>
</ol>


<h3>Answers</h3>

<h4>Others</h4>

<p>(3) Given 2 sorted arrays, how do I get the median of the combined 2 arrays?</p>

<p>The basic idea is that if you are given two arrays A and B and know the length of each, you can check whether an element A[i] is the median in constant time. Suppose that the median is A[i].
Since the array is sorted, it is greater than exactly i − 1 values in array A.
Then if it is the median, it is also greater than exactly j = ceil(n/2) − (i − 1) elements in B.
It requires constant time to check if B[j] &lt;= A[i] &lt;= B[j + 1].
If A[i] is not the median, then depending on whether A[i] is greater or less than B[j] and B[j + 1], you know that A[i] is either greater than or less than the median.
Thus you can binary search for A[i] in O(lg n) worst-case time.</p>

<p>(4) Given a sorted array and a number k, find 2 number a, b such that a + b = k.</p>

<p>Time O(n) and O(n) for sorted and unsorted array.
a) If the array is sorted, use two pointers at the two ends of the aray.
b) If the array is not sorted, create a hash table with keys as (k-a[i]). Then look up for each a[i] in the table. Table insertion and table look-up is O(1).</p>

<h4>OOP</h4>

<p>(1) What is OOP?</p>

<ul>
<li>OOP: a programming paradigm that uses objects to design computer applications. Here, objects are special data structures that consist of data fields and methods interacting with those data fields. OOP techniques includes the followings: data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, messaging.</li>
<li>Data abstraction: means that we interact with data in objects using its abstract interface. For example, we access private data of an object using its public methods. It is a mechanism to restrict the access to some of data structure&rsquo;s component, usually to separate the implementation details of the data structure.</li>
<li>Encapsulation: in simple definition, the implementation details of a program is separated from its representation. It means that we separate &ldquo;what an object can do&rdquo; and &ldquo;how the object do it&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Inheritance: is the ability of a class to expand as a subclass, so that the code can be reused.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: is the ability of a class can be considered as different forms.</li>
<li>Message passing: in OOP, a message is the single means to pass control to an object. Alan Kay has argued that message passing is more important than objects in OOP, and that objects themselves are often over-emphasized.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://tdongsi.github.io/SqlTests/blog/2016/09/02/tutorial-test-driven-development/"/>
    <updated>2016-09-02T22:57:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://tdongsi.github.io/SqlTests/blog/2016/09/02/tutorial-test-driven-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- Reference:
Evernote: "QE cheat sheet"
-->


<p>Test-driven development has become more and more important.
As pointed out in <a href="http://tdongsi.github.io/SqlTests/syllabus/">this</a>, candidates with 3+ years of industry experience should be able to demonstrate testing experience.
You should expect testing questions come up, even when you interview for developer positions.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Type of tests</h3>

<p>This is useful for the open questions of &ldquo;How do you test X?&rdquo; type.
X can be anything that are not related to software.
It would be awesome if you can come up with a creative test case that interviewers won&rsquo;t think of.
However, you are usually expected to hit broadly and methodically different categories of tests, instead of keeping listing different test cases of a test category.
Knowing these kind of tests can also help you keep talking without running out of ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Integration testing</li>
<li>Functional testing</li>
<li>Load testing</li>
<li>Stress testing</li>
<li>Performance testing</li>
<li>Install/Uninstall testing</li>
<li>UI testing</li>
<li>Localization testing (language, market-ready)</li>
<li>Security testing</li>
<li>Acceptance testing</li>
<li>Regression testing</li>
</ul>


<p>Other general types:</p>

<ul>
<li>White-box testing</li>
<li>Black-box testing</li>
<li>Beta testing</li>
</ul>


<p>Questions that I will ask myself if I am the interviewer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the candidate ask good questions to understand the feature or he/she just simply making assumptions?</li>
<li>Is the candidate covering negative and boundary conditions?</li>
<li>Is the candidate trying to break the feature? Any interesting test cases you haven’t thought of?</li>
<li>Is the candidate covering non-functional tests such as performance, scalability, security, etc.?</li>
</ul>


<p>Make sure that you pass all those minimum expections: ask clarifying questions and highlight assumptions.</p>

<h3>Example of a testing question</h3>

<p>For example, the interviewer will give you a question: &ldquo;Given a string, reverse it word by word&rdquo;.
You proceed to solve it and write it on the whiteboard.
The follow-up question would be &ldquo;How would you test it?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>(1) General</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; => &ldquo;World Hello&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Foo Bar Baz&rdquo; => &ldquo;Baz Bar Foo&rdquo;</li>
<li>What happens with unicode?</li>
<li>What about tabs and newlines? Do newlines end up in the beginning or end?</li>
<li>What about unicode whitespace?</li>
<li>What about numbers? What about special characters like ! and #.</li>
</ul>


<p>(2) Boundary</p>

<ul>
<li>Null string: null => what happens?</li>
<li>Empty string: &ldquo;&rdquo; => &ldquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Really long string => What happens?</li>
<li>What about a one really really long word?</li>
<li>What if you just give a string of spaces <code>"     "</code> => <code>"     "</code>?</li>
<li>What if you give a really string of letters separated by spaces? <code>"a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a aa a"</code></li>
<li>Does it handle Chinese well?</li>
<li>What if there&rsquo;s multiple spaces? Are they respected? <code>"a a a b ob"</code></li>
</ul>


<p>(3) Exceptional</p>

<ul>
<li>What happens when you give a really long string (like from <code>/dev/random</code>)?</li>
<li>How can the function run out of memory?</li>
<li>What if the type is incorrect? Could happen in Python.</li>
<li>null => depends on specification. Might not be possible in languages like Haskell.</li>
</ul>


<p>Four and five are bonus stuff that I like to cover or have been asked of me in the past.
They generally aren&rsquo;t the first three that I think of when I&rsquo;m asked to test a function though.</p>

<p>(4) Performance - Running time</p>

<p>I would explain the space complexity I expect out of my solution.
I would draw a simple graph of what it would probably look like.
I would then provide a set of sample points that I would take to see the space complexity.
Some sample points I would take are 0, 1, 5, 10, <code>100</code>, <code>1,000</code>, <code>10,000</code>, <code>100,000</code>, <code>1,000,000</code> until I hit some barrier and then draw more fine grain values in between.
Basically, I&rsquo;d increase the input exponentially and then increase granularity from there.</p>

<p>(5) Performancce - Space complexity</p>

<p>Very similar to (4), I would explain the space complexity I expect out of my solution.
I would draw a simple graph of what it would probably look like.
I would then provide a set of sample points that I would take to see the space complexity.
Personally, I would mention that many languages like Java allow you to run at a reduced heap size like 4 MB so that you can hit <code>OutOfMemory</code> exceptions very quickly with reasonably sized inputs, if the complexity isn&rsquo;t managed properly.</p>

<p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/">Question</a>:
Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named <code>Person</code>, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.</p>
