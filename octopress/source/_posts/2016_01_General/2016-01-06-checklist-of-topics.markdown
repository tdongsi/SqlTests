Don't study way more topics than you needed to. Based on [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20170308043103/https://googleyasheck.com/what-you-need-to-know-for-your-google-interview-and-what-you-dont/) from the same one who created [this syllabus](/blog/2011/01/05/exhaustive-syllabus/).

Legends:

* GTG: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
* 

### Essential

* complexity/space analysis

* linked lists
* stacks
* queues/deques
* arrays/vectors
* hash tables (maps)
* sets
* binary search
* sorting
    * selection
    * insertion
    * heapsort
    * quicksort
    * merge sort
* priority queues
* binary heap
* trees
    * binary search trees
    * balanced search trees (general concept)
    * traversals: preorder, inorder, postorder, BFS, DFS
* Graphs (GTG-14.1, 14.2)
    * directed
    * undirected
    * adjacency matrix
    * adjacency list
    * adjacency map
    * edge list
* dynamic programming
* probability
* permutations and combinations
* object-oriented programming
* processes/threading
    * memory
    * caching
    * deadlock avoidance
    * scheduling
* testing practices (1+ year experience)

Experienced hire:

* network stack / OSI
* scaling large systems
* designing for scale
* Design patterns

### Advanced: 

These algorithm topics will help you better in competitive programming (e.g., Google CodeJam).

* Dijkstra - single-source shortest paths (GTG 14.6)
* Bellman-Ford - single-source shortest paths, allowing negative weight edges
* Floyd-Warshall - all-pairs shortest paths
* Ford-Fulkerson - maximum flow
* Linear-time sorts:
    * radix sort
    * bucket sort
    * counting sort
* pattern/substring matching: (GTG 13.2)
    * Rabin-Karp
    * Boyer-Moore (Horspool)
    * Knuth-Morris-Pratt
    * suffix trees
    * suffix arrays
    * tries
* union-find / disjoint sets

### Not needed: 

You only need to know the basic concepts.

* Minimum spanning tree (GTG-14.7)
    * Prim-Jarnik
    * Kruskal
* geometric algorithms
    * convex hull
    * positional/overlap/horizons
* backtracking
* Selection (k smallest items, etc)
* Other types of trees:
    * (a,b) trees, k-ary trees (example: (2,4)-trees)
    * B-trees
    * k-D trees
* balanced search trees (details such as rotations)
    * red-black trees
    * AVL
    * splay trees
* data compression, information theory
* linear programming
* garbage collection
* cryptography
* skip lists
* van Emde Boas trees
* treap
* multisets
* multimaps
* fast Fourier transform
* Bloom filter
