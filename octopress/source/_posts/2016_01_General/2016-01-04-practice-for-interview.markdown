Some experience and lessons for your practices before the interviews.

### Some common mistakes

#### Mistake 1: No repetitions

When I first started studying, I was watching videos all day long, taking tons of notes, and trying to remember. 
I also spent time implementing data structures and their associated algorithms. 
I would spend 10 hours watching videos on hash tables, for instance.

Over time, I realized I was forgetting things. 
I wasn't reviewing my notes and felt like all the hours I invested in watching videos was mostly wasted.

What I should have done for each topic:

* watch a couple of hours of videos on the topic, to get the main idea
* implement the algorithms and data structures
* make flash cards for important things I should remember about the topic
* move on to the next topic
* review the flash cards when you have time
* after a few days, watch another video about the topic, perhaps 30 mins or so
* after another week, watch a video about the topic, maybe same video or shorter one
* keep reviewing flash cards

The thing to notice here is repetition. 
Spending one or two days watching videos on a topic just reinforces what you recently learned in the last hours. 
This is not strong knowledge reinforcement. 
You will forget.

I go back through all my notes and put them into flash cards. 
Many, many (too many) flash cards.

You have to leave a time interval between learning something for the first time, and reviewing it later.

The important point is: review a topic over several time intervals. 
It will continue to reinforce and remind you, and you won't forget it. 
The time interval can get longer over time. 
This is called "spaced repetition" (thanks to commenter).
