Some experience and lessons for your on-site interviews.

<!--more-->

### Walk through the problem

If you know to solve the problem, talk to the interviewers to explain how you get to the solution.
If you don't know, it is NEVER a good idea to just stare at the problem before you can get it and start working on it. 
Use the [this flowchart](/download/cracking_the_coding_skills_v6.pdf) to verbalize your thought process when you are stuck.

The flowchart's primary purpose is not to help you solve the problem faster.
Instead, it gives you something to talk about with your interviewer and maybe start the discussion.
At least, it gives your interviewer some positive data points, instead of binary data (problem solved or not) in the case of silent staring.

Talking while thinking about a problem is never easy or practical, especially for hard problems.
You can ask for a brief moment of silence ("hey can I have a minute just to think about this, then I'll start talking about how I'm gonna approach this?").
However, there is no practical solution to this scenario (or technical interview in general) except for practices.
