1. Serialize binary tree.
1. Count the number of occurrences of a given element in a sorted array.
1. Modify binary search to find the index of first/last occurrence of x in the array. Two binary searches. 
1. Design a program to take a string and store, each character, into an array. The array should return a count of each character when called. [The interviewer was clearly trying to blur the lines between a simple program and a MapReduce]
1. Senior Test Engineer: A user logs in to a website with proper credentials and the user is taken to a blank page. How would you troubleshoot that?  
1. Senior Test Engineer: Create a stack with the usual push() & pop(), but with an additional function getMiddle() that returns the middle element of the stack in constant time. 
1. Senior Test Engineer: Search a sorted array for the first element larger than k.
1. You have a potentially very-large set of documents, which are potentially very-large, and contain text. For searching these documents, they've been pre-processed into a (very-large) table mapping words to the set of documents that contain each word. E.g. (word) : (documents (referenced by ID) containing that word) Apple: 1, 4, 5, 6, 32 Banana: 5, 6, 7, 9, 32 Cantaloupe: 1, 2, 6 ... Clients will pass in a set ...  
1. Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth For example, given the list `[[1,1],2,[1,1]]` the function should return 10 (four 1 at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1). Answer: Recursion or Use a stack while iterating through the input string.

2) Calculate Fibonacci-like sequence: f(n) = f(n-1) + â€¦ + f(n-k) where f(i) = 0 if i < 0 and f(0) = 1. Your algorithm should avoid shifting lots of number.

[edit]Concurrency
	1. How to write a thread-safe or reentrant function. What is the difference between a reentrant function.

		* Reentrant and thread-safe is actually two separate concepts.
Object oriented programming
	* What is OOP? What is abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism?
	* 
		* OOP: a programming paradigm that uses objects to design computer applications. Here, objects are special data structures that consist of data fields and methods interacting with those data fields. OOP techniques includes the followings: data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, messaging.
		* Data abstraction: means that we interact with data in objects using its abstract interface. For example, we access private data of an object using its public methods. It is a mechanism to restrict the access to some of data structure's component, usually to separate the implementation details of the data structure.
		* Encapsulation: in simple definition, the implementation details of a program is separated from its representation. It means that we separate "what an object can do" and "how the object do it".
		* Inheritance: is the ability of a class to expand as a subclass, so that the code can be reused.
		* Polymorphism: is the ability of a class can be considered as different forms.
		* Message passing: in OOP, a message is the single means to pass control to an object. Alan Kay has argued that message passing is more important than objects in OOP, and that objects themselves are often over-emphasized [2].



### Answers


3) [5]: The basic idea is that if you are given two arrays A and B and know the length of each, you can check whether an element A[i] is the median in constant time. Suppose that the median is A[i]. Since the array is sorted, it is greater than exactly i âˆ’ 1 values in array A. Then if it is the median, it is also greater than exactly j = ceil(n/2) âˆ’ (i âˆ’ 1) elements in B. It requires constant time to check if B[j] <= A[i] <= B[j + 1]. If A[i] is not the median, then depending on whether A[i] is greater or less than B[j] and B[j + 1], you know that A[i] is either greater than or less than the median. Thus you can binary search for A[i] in O(lg n) worst-case time.
4) Time O(n) and O(n) for sorted and unsorted array.

	* If the array is sorted, use two pointers at the two ends of the aray.
	* If the array is not sorted, create a hash table with keys as (k-a[i]). Then look up for each a[i] in the table. Table insertion and table look-up is O(1).
