1. Serialize binary tree.
1. Count the number of occurrences of a given element in a sorted array.
1. Modify binary search to find the index of first/last occurrence of x in the array. Two binary searches. 
1. Design a program to take a string and store, each character, into an array. The array should return a count of each character when called. [The interviewer was clearly trying to blur the lines between a simple program and a MapReduce]
1. Senior Test Engineer: A user logs in to a website with proper credentials and the user is taken to a blank page. How would you troubleshoot that?  
1. Senior Test Engineer: Create a stack with the usual push() & pop(), but with an additional function getMiddle() that returns the middle element of the stack in constant time. 
1. Senior Test Engineer: Search a sorted array for the first element larger than k.
1. You have a potentially very-large set of documents, which are potentially very-large, and contain text. For searching these documents, they've been pre-processed into a (very-large) table mapping words to the set of documents that contain each word. E.g. (word) : (documents (referenced by ID) containing that word) Apple: 1, 4, 5, 6, 32 Banana: 5, 6, 7, 9, 32 Cantaloupe: 1, 2, 6 ... Clients will pass in a set ...  
1. Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth For example, given the list `[[1,1],2,[1,1]]` the function should return 10 (four 1 at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1). Answer: Recursion or Use a stack while iterating through the input string.
1. Create an isNumber(string) function. Handle signed / unsigned, floating point, any number of digits, etc. Probably commas, and currency signs, or whatever. It was open ended and governed by whatever unit tests he wanted you to make it work against.
1. Find out at least one 3 elements array in a given integer array. The 3 elements have to be able to form a triangle.
1. Write a program to replace 0s with 5 in a given number. Eg: 1208 -> 1258, 120096045 -> 125596545  
1. Write a function to find the power of a^b
1. Find the minimum distance between 2 words in a dictionary
1. Evaluate a post-fix expression
1. Given an array of numbers , replace each number with the product of all the numbers divided by the number at that index without using the division operator.
1. Write a function that, given a list of integers (both positive and negative) returns the sum of the contiguous subsequence with maximum sum. Thus, given the sequence (1, 2, -4, 1, 3, -2, 3, -1) it should return 5.
1. Write a function that would find the largest palindrome (phone interview).
1. Write a Binary Search Tree class with isBST() method that will validate if the tree is a BST (onsite).
